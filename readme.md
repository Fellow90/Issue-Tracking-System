<!-- Update Your Form:

Create a Django form that includes the ImageField. Make sure to set enctype="multipart/form-data" in your HTML form to handle file uploads.

python
Copy code
from django import forms

class TicketForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Ticket
        fields = ['reporting_person', 'epic', 'severity', 'company_name', 'ticket_id', 'description', 'image', 'code']
Create a View to Handle Form Submission:

Create a view to handle the form submission, validate the uploaded image, and save it to the database.

python
Copy code
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from .forms import TicketForm

def create_ticket(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = TicketForm(request.POST, request.FILES)
        if form.is_valid():
            # Save the form data, including the uploaded image
            ticket = form.save()
            # Perform any additional logic you need
            return redirect('ticket_detail', pk=ticket.pk)
    else:
        form = TicketForm()
    return render(request, 'ticket_create.html', {'form': form})
Create a Template for the Form:

Create an HTML template (e.g., ticket_create.html) for rendering the form, including the ImageField. Ensure that the form includes enctype="multipart/form-data".

html
Copy code
<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form.as_p }}
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
Display Uploaded Images:

To display uploaded images on your site, you can access the url attribute of the ImageField in your template. For example:

html
Copy code
<img src="{{ ticket.image.url }}" alt="Ticket Image">
With these steps, you'll have an ImageField in your model, a form to upload images, and the ability to read and display uploaded images in your templates. The uploaded images will be stored in the issue_images/ directory within your media root as specified in the upload_to parameter of the ImageField. -->


        <!-- <p><a href="{% url 'ticket_detail' ticket.ticket_id %}">Click here!!</a></p> -->
